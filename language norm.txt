-----var-----

var [local] (name1) (name2) ...
	Declare one or more variables,But you can't assign values to them.
	Variables can be used globally or localized by adding "local".

-----let-----

let (variable) (variable)
let (variable) (constant)
	Only one variable can be assigned at a time.

-----print-----

print (anything)...
	Can print anything except math/logic registers.

println (anything)...
	Print anything and wrap lines automatically.

-----math/logic-----

registers:
	Can only be used in math/logical commands.
	Because the mathematical expression is too complex, the split step operation is used.
	All registers are 8-bit signed numbers.(signed long)
	
	ax : math/logical operation
	bx : math/logical operation
	cx : comparison results,will be used in conditional branch statements(if...elseif...else) and loop statements(while)
		greater
		gequal
		equal
		lequal
		lesser
	dx : difference between two numbers
	n0x to n15x : prepare for math/logic operations.
	tx : times register,will be used in a loop statement(for).

mov (register) (anything)
	Move anything into a register.

mvo (variable) (register)
	Move the value of a register into a variable.
